1. Argument and Option

clear : clear screen
date : date of today
cal : calender of this month
cal 2030 : calender of 2030
cal 9 2021 : calender of september in 2021
cal 2021 9 -> Do not work
cal -y : calender of this year
cal -B 2 : show calender from two months before to this month
cal -A 2 : show calender from this month to two months after
cal -B 2 -A 2 == cal -A 2 -B 2
cal -j : date is count from January 1st
cal -jA 2 -B 2 == -A 2 -jB 2
cal -Aj 2 -B 2 : Do Not Work
cal -h : unhighlight today
man cal : manual of cal
On the manual -> space : go down 1 page, b : go up 1 page, q : quit manual and go back

2. Directory

~ (tilde) : Home directory of current user
pwd : Print the name of Working Directory, Print current directory
print result -> /Users/jutlo : the first '/' is the root directory

cd : Change Directory, change current directory
cd /Users/jutlo/Pictures
pwd
-> print result : /Users/jutlo/Pictures

cd ~
change to home directory again
and
cd /Users/jutlo/Pictures == cd ./Pictures : '.' means current directory

Let's keep going

cd ../Documents : '..' means the parent directory of current directory
pwd 
-> print result : /Users/jutlo/Documents

When change to child directory of current directory -> cd Pictures == cd ./Pictures

cd / : change directory to root directory
cd ~ : change directory to home directory
cd - : change directory to previous directory

ls : show the list of child directories and files in the current directory
ls -l : long list format -> more detailed info
ls -a : all -> show all the hidden directories and hidden files
* ls command doesn't show the files or directories whose name start with '.' (hidden) -> -a option let ls command show hidden directories and files whose name start with '.'
* Usually files that is not to be modified are hidden
